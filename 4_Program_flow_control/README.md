#  JavaScript prework - Program flow control


#### Guidelines:

* do all exercises from this section in the script.js file,
* separate exercises with comments,
* remember to define different variable names in each exercise so they do not overwrite each other!
  (excluding loops where we use ```i``` or ```j``` interchangeably)
* at the end there are additional exercises. They are not obligatory to pass the prework but try to complete them anyway.

#### Exercise 1

In script.js create two variables with numbers. Now, using ```if ... else ```, write in the console which of the numbers is greater.

#### Exercise 2

In script.js create three variables with numbers. Now, using **if**, **else if** and **else**
(you can use the logical operator ```&&```, try to find information about it on your own) write in the console which of the numbers is the greatest.


#### Exercise 3
In script.js create a loop that will write 10 times "I like JavaScript" in the console.

#### Exercise 4
In script.js create a variable named ```result``` and assign number 0 to it. Then, create a loop that will add all integers in the range from 1 to 10.

#### Exercise 5
In script.js write a program that will write all integers ranging from 0 to **n** based on the value of the variable **n**, e.g. ```var n = 5;```.
For each number the program should write whether the number is even or not. E.g.:

```JavaScript
0 – even
1 – odd
2 – even
3 – odd
...
```

*Hint: How do we check whether the number is even or odd? Just compute the number modulo 2. If the result is 0, then the number is even; otherwise, it is odd.*

#### Exercise 6
In script.js create two independent loops and write the values of their counters in each iteration. Use concatenation,
e.g.```console.log("i= " + i + ", j= " + j);```


#### Exercise 7
In script.js in a comment there is a script that writes in the console a scheme of **n** asterisks (stars), just like the one below. Find that script and study it carefully.
Example for  ```n = 5```:

```
* * * * *

* * * * *

* * * * *

* * * * *

* * * * *
```

We use the nested loops in this exercise!
#### Exercise 8

In script.js write a program that will draw the following scheme based in the value of **n** variable (here you can see a scheme for ```n = 5```). Use nested loops.

```
*
* *
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *
```

You can do this task in two ways:
1. using nested loops.
2. using independent loops and **if**.

*Use the previous exercise as a base for this one. You need to rack your brains a little and understand how nested loops work.*

#### Exercise 9 - for volunteers

In script.js write a program that will draw the following scheme based on the value of variable **n** (here you can see a scheme for```n = 5```):

```
* 2 3 4 5
* * 3 4 5
* * * 4 5
* * * * 5
* * * * *
* * * * *
* * * * 5
* * * 4 5
* * 3 4 5
* 2 3 4 5
```

#### Exercise 10 - for volunteers

In script.js write a program that will create a multiplication table for a given variable **n**. Write the result in the console. For example, for ```n = 3``` the program will generate the following result:


1 x 1 = 1 | 1 x 2 = 2 | 1 x 3 = 3 <br>
2 x 1 = 2 | 2 x 2 = 4 | 2 x 3 = 6 <br>
3 x 1 = 3 | 3 x 2 = 6 | 3 x 3 = 9


Use ***** operator to multiply numbers.
